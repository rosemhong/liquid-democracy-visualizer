TODO:

hard
- splitting vote among multiple delegates equally? (topo sort)

later
- run simulations by varying a parameter and holding rest constant
    - look at average accuracy + correct elections
        - compare to direct democracy

    - simple ones (ignore weight limit + delegation degree)
        - varying total voters
        - varying competence mean and sd
        - varying connect probability for graph type 1
        - varying threshold diff



- graph results
- improve visualization (ie add distance from root, gradient, show accuracy)
- presentation
- write report
